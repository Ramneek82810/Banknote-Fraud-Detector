# 🏦 Banknote Authentication using Gaussian Naive Bayes 

## 📜 Project Description

Welcome to the Banknote Authentication project! 🎉 This project uses Gaussian Naive Bayes 🧑‍💻 to classify banknotes as real or fake based on their physical features. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a banknote is authentic or counterfeit. 💡

## 🔍 Problem Statement

This project aims to classify banknotes into two categories:

- Real Banknotes 🏅

- Fake Banknotes 💸

By analyzing different features (like variance, skewness, curtosis, and entropy), the model learns to distinguish between genuine and forged banknotes. 🧐

## 🧠 Methodology

We utilize the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm 🔮, a probabilistic classifier that assumes features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. This method helps the model learn from the data and make predictions with high accuracy. 🤖

## 🧰 Features Used

The dataset includes the following features to help with prediction:

- Variance 📐

- Skewness 🎯

- Curtosis 🏁

- Entropy 🔥

## ⚙️ Tools and Technologies

- Python 🐍

- Scikit-learn 📚

- Pandas 🗃️

- NumPy ➗

- Matplotlib 📈
