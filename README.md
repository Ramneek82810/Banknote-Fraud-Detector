# 🏛️ Banknote Fraud-Detection Using Gaussian Naive-Bayes

This project focuses on the detection of forged banknotes using machine learning. A **Gaussian Naive Bayes** classifier is employed to distinguish between real and fake currency based on features extracted from the images of banknotes.

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **File**: `banknotes.csv`
- **Features**:
  - Variance of Wavelet Transformed Image
  - Skewness of Wavelet Transformed Image
  - Kurtosis of Wavelet Transformed Image
  - Entropy
- **Target**:
  - `0`: Authentic
  - `1`: Forged  
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 🧠 Model Used
- **Algorithm**: Gaussian Naive Bayes
- **Why Naive Bayes?**
  - Fast and simple
  - Works well with small datasets
  - Assumes feature independence, suitable for this dataset
